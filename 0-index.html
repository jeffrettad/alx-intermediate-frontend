    <h2> Why Learning to Code Is a Game-Changer in 2025</h2>
    <p>In today's fast-paced digital world, learning to 
        code is no longer just for software engineers or
            computer science majors. It's a foundational skill
            that empowers individuals across industries—from marketing
            and finance to education and healthcare—to solve problems, 
            automate tasks, and build innovative solutions.</p>
            <h2> What Is Coding, Really?</h2>
            <p>At its core, coding is the process of giving instructions 
            to computers in a language they understand. These languages—like 
            Python, JavaScript, and HTML—allow you to create websites, apps, games, 
            and even control smart devices. But beyond just writing code,
                learning programming teaches logical thinking, problem-solving,
                and patience—skills that are valuable in every profession.</p>
